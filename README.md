## License Plate Detection and Recognition  

### 📌 Overview  
This project detects and recognizes license plate numbers from images using deep learning models. It leverages **YOLO for license plate detection** and **CRNN for character recognition** to extract and process plate numbers accurately.  

### 🚀 Features  
- **License Plate Detection**: Uses **YOLO** to detect plates in images.  
- **Preprocessing**: Converts images to grayscale and applies thresholding or edge detection.  
- **OCR for Text Recognition**: Utilizes **EasyOCR** and **CRNN** for reading license plate characters.  
- **Post-processing**: Cleans extracted text and formats it into standard license plate formats.  

### 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV**  
- **YOLO** (for license plate detection)  
- **EasyOCR & Custom OCR** (for text recognition)  
- **PyTorch** (for CRNN-based OCR model)
